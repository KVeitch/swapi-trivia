# Star Wars Trivia
Star Wars Trivia is a web application that allows you to navigate information from 7 of the infamous Star Wars movies.
As a user, you can submit your name, your favorite star wars quote, and a ranking of your current star wars knowledge. The UI will navigate to view the 7 available movies, and allows you to view the characters of each movie. When viewing a character you can mark your favorites and navigate to a separate link where you can view all of your favorite characters in one spot, NEAT!
